Description: Implements a very fast C++ algorithm to quickly bootstrap 
    receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and derived performance metrics, including the area under the 
    curve (AUC) as well as the true and false positive rate. The analysis of paired
    receiver operating curves is supported as well, so that a comparison of two predictors is possible.
    You can also plot the results and calculate confidence intervals.
    Currently the calculation of 100000 bootstrap replicates for 500 observations 
    takes about one second.
