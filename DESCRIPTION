Description: Implements a very fast C++ algorithm to quickly bootstrap 
    ROC Curves and derived performance metrics (e.g. AUC). You can also plot the
    results and calculate confidence intervals.
    Currently the calculation of 100000 bootstrap replicates for 500 observations 
    takes about one second.
