Description: Implements a very fast C++ algorithm to quickly bootstrap receiver
    operating characteristics (ROC) curves and derived performance metrics,
    including the area under the curve (AUC) as well as the true and false positive
    rate. The analysis of paired receiver operating curves is supported as well,
    so that a comparison of two predictors is possible. You can also plot the
    results and calculate confidence intervals. On a typical desktop computer the time needed for 
    the calculation of 100000 bootstrap replicates given 500 observations requires time on the
    order of magnitude of one second.
