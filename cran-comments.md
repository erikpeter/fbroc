## Apology for early resubmit

Sorry for the early resubmit, but I found a serious bug in an important plotting function. I added
the broken functionality in an example to make certain I detect any reoccurence in the future early
on.

## Tested on
* local 64 bit Windows 7, R 3.2.2
* win-builder devel and release
* Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS 64 bit, R 3.2.2 - including valgrind on examples

## R CMD Check results
No ERRORS, WARNINGS. One Note:

NOTE
Maintainer: 'Erik Peter <jerikpeter@googlemail.com>'

Days since last update: 4

See apology above. Sorry again.

## Downstream dependencies

There are no packages that depend on fbroc as of now.
