## Submission history

This is the second try to commit this package. I spelled out Receiver Operating Characteristics and
area under the curve. The note is still there because I still included the abbreviations in 
brackets. While I agree that the rule makes sense, I was not able to find it in the manual. Would
be grateful for a pointer, if you have the reference at hand and it is no effort.

## Tested on
* local 64 bit Windows 7, R 3.2.0
* win-builder devel and release

## R CMD Check results
No ERRORS or WARNINGS.

One NOTE:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

Maintainer: 'Erik Peter <jerikpeter@googlemail.com>'

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  AUC (9:54)
  ROC (3:37, 9:5)
  
The abbreviations are given after the fully spelled out proper name.

## Downstream dependencies

There are no packages that depend on fbroc as of now.
